      text: "<h2>Top emitters</h2>China, USA, and India together emitted almost half of the total amount of emitted carbon dioxide in 2017 (Global Carbon Atlas 2017). Carbon dioxide is an important part of the atmosphere. It contributes to the greenhouse effect, which causes heat to stay on the planet. However, if the atmosphere has too much carbon dioxide, the planet will become warmer (NASA 2019). This causes glaciers and permafrost to melt, while corals and other ocean life dies because of the high amount of carbon dioxide in the water (Earth Vision Trust 2018). ",
